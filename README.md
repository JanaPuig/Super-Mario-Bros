## About the game
_Super Mario Bros_ is a platform video game developed and published by Nintendo in 1985. The game follows the adventures of Mario, a plumber who tries to rescue Princess Peach from the evil Bowser. It is considered one of the most iconic titles in video game history and a cornerstone of the platformer genre.

## Our Objective
Our objective is to recreate the first level of the original video game using the C++ programming language and the Box2D physics engine in Visual Studio.

## Gameplay

The player controls Mario (or his brother Luigi in multiplayer mode) through levels filled with enemies and obstacles. Players must move sideways, jump, and run to avoid dangers, collect coins, and unlock power-ups like the mushroom that increases Mario's size or the fire flower that allows him to throw fireballs. 
For now, only level 1 has been implemented, but the levels include different types of terrain, such as grasslands, underground caves, aquatic worlds, and castles filled with traps.

## Controls
* Move left/right: A/D
* Jump: Space/W
* Run: Left Control
* Crouch: S
* Revive when dead: T
